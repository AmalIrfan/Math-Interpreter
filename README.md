# Math Interpreter

A simple math interpreter or arithmetic expression interpreter, written in python3. This project is inspired by [David Callanan](https://github.com/davidcallanan/)'s py-myopl-code and py-simple-math-interpreter. My main goal was to implementing this in a functional style intead of Object Oriented Style as [David Callanan](https://github.com/davidcallanan/)'s have done.
